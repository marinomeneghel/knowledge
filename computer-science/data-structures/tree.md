Much like real life, there are many different types of tree data structures.
- Binary Trees:
  AA Tree, AVL Tree, Binary Search Tree, Binary Tree, Cartesian Tree,
  left child/right sibling tree, order statistic tree, Pagoda, ...
- B Trees:
  B Tree, B+ Tree, B* Tree, B Sharp Tree, Dancing Tree, 2-3 Tree, ...
- Heaps:
  Heap, Binary Heap, Weak Heap, Binomial Heap, Fibonacci Heap, Leonardo
  Heap, 2-3 Heap, Soft Heap, Pairing Heap, Leftist Heap, Treap, ...
- Trees:
  Trie, Radix Tree, Suffix Tree, Suffix Array, FM-index, B-trie, ...
- Multi-way Trees:
  Ternary Tree, K-ary tree, And-or tree, (a,b)-tree, Link/Cut Tree, ...
- Space Partitioning Trees:
  Segment Tree, Interval Tree, Range Tree, Bin, Kd Tree, Quadtree,
  Octree, Z-Order, UB-Tree, R-Tree, X-Tree, Metric Tree, Cover Tree, ...
- Application-Specific Trees:
  Abstract Syntax Tree, Parse Tree, Decision Tree, Minimax Tree, ...

Little did you know you'd be studying dendrology today... and that's not even
all of them. But don't let any of this scare you, most of those don't matter
at all. There were just a lot of Computer Science PhDs who had something to
prove.

Trees are much like graphs or linked lists except they are "unidirectional".
All this means is that they can't have loops of references (DAG).

       Tree:                Not a Tree:
         A                        A
       ↙   ↘                    ↗   ↘
     B       C                B ←–––– C

If you can draw a loop between connected nodes in a tree... well, you don't
have a tree.

Trees have many different uses, they can be used to optimize searching or
sorting. They can organize programs better. They can give you a
representation that is easier to work with.

/**
 * Binary search trees are a fairly common form of tree for their ability to
 * efficiently access, search, insert, and delete values all while keeping them
 * in a sorted order.
 *
 * Imagine taking a sequence of numbers:
 *
 *     1  2  3  4  5  6  7
 *
 * And turning it into a tree starting from the center.
 *
 *              4
 *           /     \
 *        2           6
 *      /   \       /   \
 *     1     3     5     7
 *    -^--^--^--^--^--^--^-
 *     1  2  3  4  5  6  7
 *
 * This is how a binary tree works. Each node can have two children:
 *
 *     - Left: Less than parent node's value.
 *     - Right: Greater than parent node's value.
 *
 * > Note: In order to make this work all values must be unique in the tree.
 *
 * This makes the traversal to find a value very efficient. Say we're trying to
 * find the number 5 in our tree:
 *
 *             (4)         <--- 5 > 4, so move right.
 *           /     \
 *        2         (6)    <--- 5 < 6, so move left.
 *      /   \       /   \
 *     1     3    (5)    7 <--- We've reached 5!
 *
 * Notice how we only had to do 3 checks to reach the number 5. If we were to
 * expand this tree to 1000 items. We'd go:
 *
 *   500 -> 250 -> 125 -> 62 -> 31 -> 15 -> 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
 *
 * Only 10 checks for 1000 items!
 *
 * The other important thing about binary search trees is that they are similar
 * to linked lists in the sense that you only need to update the immediately
 * surrounding items when adding or removing a value.

*Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree*
Binary search tree imposes the condition that, for all nodes, the left children are less than or equal to the current node, which is less then all the right nodes.

*Balanced vs Unbalanced*
Balancing a tree implies only that the depth of subtrees will not vary by more than a certain amount. It does not mean that the left and right subtrees are exactly the same size.

*Full and Complete*
Full and complete trees are trees in which all leaves are at the bottom of the tree, and all non-leaf nodes have exactly two children. Note that full and complete trees are extremely rare, as a tree must have exactly 2^n - 1 nodes to meet this condition.

*Types of traversal*
Pre-order:
1. Check if the current node is empty / null.
2. Display the data part of the root (or current node) or do an operation.
3. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the pre-order function.
4. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the pre-order function.

In-order:
1. Check if the current node is empty / null.
2. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the in-order function.
3. Display the data part of the root (or current node) or do an operation.
4. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the in-order function.

Post-order:
1. Check if the current node is empty / null.
2. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the post-order function.
3. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the post-order function.
4. Display the data part of the root (or current node) or do an operation.

Questions:
1. Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. The tree is balanced if the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.
2. Given a sorted array with unique integers, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with miniaml height.
3. Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree
4. Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree.
5. You are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value. Design an algorithm to print all paths which sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go in a straight line down.
6. https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/an-introduction-to-binary-search-and-red-black-trees/
Implement:
- [ ] insert    // insert value into tree
- [ ] get_node_count // get count of values stored
- [ ] print_values // prints the values in the tree, from min to max
- [ ] delete_tree
- [ ] is_in_tree // returns true if given value exists in the tree
- [ ] get_height // returns the height in nodes (single node's height is 1)
- [ ] get_min   // returns the minimum value stored in the tree
- [ ] get_max   // returns the maximum value stored in the tree
- [ ] is_binary_search_tree
- [ ] delete_value
- [ ] get_successor // returns next-highest value in tree after given value, -1 if none
